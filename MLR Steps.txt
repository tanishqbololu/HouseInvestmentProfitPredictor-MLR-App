***Steps for Multi Linear Regression***
1. Import python libraries
2. Import dataset
3. Convert categorical data (cities) to numerical; ONE HOT ENCODING 
4. Split data for train & test
5. Linear regression for y pred from x test
6. MLR:
	regressor.coef_ & regressor.intercept_ 
7. Check how many rows in dataset
8. Add ones column to X
9. Determine which features are significant predictors of the outcome variable.
10. Ordinary least square
11. Remove features IV with p-values greater than a certain threshold, often 0.05
12. Check training and testing score & tell model fit
13. Plot y_test vs y_pred
